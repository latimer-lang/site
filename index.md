Latimer is a general-purpose statically-typed interpreted programming language with explicit syntax designed for efficiency, safety, and developer productivity. It combines the ease-of-use of scripting languages like Python with the safety, speed, and reliability of languages like Java and C++. Most ideal for writing and debugging large scripts.
