## What is Latimer?

Latimer (/ˈlæ.tɪ.mər/) is a statically-typed, interpreted programming language. It is designed to be easy to read, easy to write, and safe to use.

Latimer is under active development and is built from the ground up with simplicity, safety, and long-term usability in focus.

## Why Latimer?

The goal of Latimer is to combine the speed and convenience of a scripting language with the safety and structure typically associated with compiled languages.
